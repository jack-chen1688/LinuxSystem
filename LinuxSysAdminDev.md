* What did you learn yesterday/this week?
* Talk about your preferred development/administration environment. (OS, Editor,
  Browsers, Tools etc.)  
Answer: Windows, NotePad++, Visual Studio Code, Chrome. 
* Tell me about the last major Linux project you finished.

* Tell me about the biggest mistake you've made in [some recent time period] and how you would do it differently today. What did you learn from this experience?
* Why we must choose you?
* What function does DNS play on a network?
* What is HTTP?  
Answer: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

* What is an HTTP proxy and how does it work?

server, and receives responses from server and forwards back to the http
client.

* What is SMTP? Give the basic scenario of how a mail message is delivered via SMTP.
* What is RAID? What is RAID0, RAID1, RAID5, RAID10?  
Answer: RAID is Redundant Array of Inexpensive/Independent Disks.   
RAID 0, stripping without parity  
RAID 1, mirroring.  
RAID 5: one parity drive.  
RAID 10: Raid 1+0.

Answer: 

* Describe the general file system hierarchy of a Linux system.
* Which difference have between public and private SSH key?  
  Answer: Two pairs of public and private keys are used by SSH. Host
  private/public keys are created when ssh server is setup. User private/public
  keys are created by user on cient machine. Public key is used to encrypt data
  and private key is used to decrypt data. Ssh clients use host public key to encrypt
  data and the ssh server use host private key to decrypt data recieved. The ssh
  server uses the user public key to encrypt data and send to the ssh client.
  And the ssh client uses the user private key to decrypt data received.

* What does CTRL-d do?  
Answer: Send EOF or exit() for terminal program. 

* What does CTRL-z do?  
Answer: Send SIGSTP to the current process, make the process stopped and
become a background process. bg command can send SIGCONT to the process. If
the process is not waiting for standard input, it will run in the background.
If the process is waiting for standard input, it will remain stopped because bg
will not reconnect standart input to the process. To make the process enter
into running state, we can use fg command, which will connect the process to
standard input.
